# **SQLv2 – The Open Standard for AI-Native Databases**

> **SQLv2 is a next-generation standard** that unifies **traditional SQL, machine learning, vector search, generative AI, and multimedia support** into a single, cohesive query language.
>
> Built for the AI era, SQLv2 eliminates the complexity of stitching together multiple systems — relational databases, vector databases, ETL pipelines, and external ML services — by bringing everything natively inside SQL.

## **Why SQLv2?**

Modern AI applications require developers to maintain **disconnected data stacks**:

* A relational database for structured data
* A separate vector database for embeddings
* External machine learning APIs
* ETL pipelines to move data between systems
* Ah! And multiple GenAI endpoints

This leads to:

* **Data silos** and inconsistent state
* **High infrastructure costs**
* **Latency and performance bottlenecks**
* **Slower development cycles**

SQLv2 solves these problems by introducing **AI-native primitives directly into the SQL language**.

---

## **Core Innovations**

SQLv2 builds on ANSI SQL while adding new constructs designed for modern AI workloads:

| Category                         | SQLv2 Features                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI/ML Functions**              | `PREDICT()`, `CLASSIFY()`, `GENERATE()`, `SENTIMENT()`                                                   |
| **Vector Search**                | Native vector type (`VECTOR(n)`), similarity operators `<=>` and `<->`, functions like `VECTOR_SEARCH()` |
| **Generative AI**                | `GENERATE()` for text synthesis, summarization, and content generation directly in SQL                   |
| **Multimedia Support**           | First-class data types: `IMAGE`, `VIDEO`, `AUDIO`, `PDF`                                                 |
| **AutoML**                       | `CREATE EXPERIMENT`, `DEPLOY MODEL`, `PREDICT ... USING ...`                                             |
| **Zero-Copy & GPU Acceleration** | Built-in performance for ML and vector operations                                                        |

## **Example Queries**

### 1. Run Machine Learning Inference

```sql
SELECT user_id, 
       PREDICT(purchase_likelihood)
FROM users;
```

---

### 2. Generative AI Inside SQL

```sql
SELECT product_id,
       GENERATE('Write a 2-sentence description for ' || product_name)
FROM products;
```

---

### 3. Vector Similarity Search

```sql
SELECT doc_id, content
FROM documents
ORDER BY embedding <=> EMBED('healthy recipes')
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### 4. Multimedia + AI in a Single Query

```sql
SELECT video_id,
       TRANSCRIBE(video_data) AS transcript,
       SUMMARIZE(TRANSCRIBE(video_data), 100) AS summary
FROM videos
WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(DIMENSIONS(video_data), '$.width') >= 1920;
```
